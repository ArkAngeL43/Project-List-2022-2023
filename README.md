# Description 

For the next year and a half I will be planning my journey as to projects I will be working on, prioritizing and profiting from. These projects and lists will explain their general description, development plan and their source language.

# 2022 - 2023

| Project name | Project Description | Project Languages | Project OS support |  Closed source | Open Source | 
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | 
| Red Rabbit   | This is an upgrade from version 1.0 and will be the new and improoved version of the framework with a whole new amazing and thread safe UI and function list, this will also be using only two languages rather than 5 and be portable to linux machines. | Go, Crystal | Linux ( Maybe windows ) | false | true | 
| Frizz Pro    | A professional version of the current version of frizz a pcap load interface which will have built in IPS's, IDS's and virus detectors and even databases for data tracing | Go, Crystal, C++, C | Windows, Linux | true | false |
| EngineX      | A professional enterprise tool used for digital forensics and OSINT with a powerful GUI packed for privacy and OSINT. This engine will be cheap and sold monthly as a engine which will allow you to search over 10 different websites and search information on people and documents. It will even have a built in system to search tor and load through suspicous websites anonymously | C++ | Windows | True | False |
| SkyLine | One of the first modern day programming languages built with a backend to cyber security. This language will be a very modern day programming language that is open sourced and able to show true colors when working with cyber security. This language also plans to be one of the more mathematically correct languages out there. | Go | Any OS that can run GO | False | True |
| RPC (Radical Processing Core) | A deep in depth and complex programming language designed for industrial systems. This language is plans to be very modern and help developers who already know development. It will be one of the very few languages out there to tell you that you should not choose a language based on the lines of code such as how many lines it takes to print data but rather how fast and how deep a language can go. RPC holds the motto "
anything easy is hard, anything hard is easy " putting you in for a real brain twist. | Go, C++, Crystal | Linux ( during beta ) | False | True |
